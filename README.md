my learning note about QuantLib

This repository contains some practice code I wrote while learning QuantLib. Firstly, I will translate the Python code from the QuantLib Python Cookbook into C++. This is the plan for the first stage.

If you have any questions or find any errors, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you.
